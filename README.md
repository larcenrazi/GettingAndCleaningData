##Getting and Cleaning Data Project

#### Project Questions:
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### How to run the program
* Download the zip file from the specified URL
* Save it to a directory on your computer (ie: C:\RCode\UCI HAR Dataset)
* set the working directory to point to where you saved your zip file(ie: setwd("C://RCodee//UCI HAR Dataset"))
* Then run the program. 
* At the end you will have a file called myTidyData.txt in your working directory.
